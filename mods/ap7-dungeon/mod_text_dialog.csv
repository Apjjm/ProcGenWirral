AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_NPC_BAR_MESSAGE_1,Apparently this place was hidden away for years without a customer.
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_NPC_BAR_MESSAGE_2,Exploring is hard work but sometimes you find a great spot to relax.
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_NPC_TABLE_NAME,Enthusiastic Ranger
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_NPC_TABLE_MESSAGE_1,They've even got live music! I wonder if they do requests?

AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_INTRO_1_DOG,"Arf?"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_INTRO_1_KAYLEIGH,"Is... That a Djinn Entonic working as a barkeep?"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_INTRO_1_MEREDITH,"Huh? A monster is working... as a barkeep?"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_INTRO_1_EUGENE,"What?! A monster behind the bar!"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_INTRO_1_FELIX,"Huh? A Djinn Entonic is running the place!"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_INTRO_1_VIOLA,"This is most unusual {player}! I've not been to a tavern with monsters behind the counter!"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_INTRO_1,"Oh![pause] It's nothing that [wave amp=30 freq=10]unusual[wave]!"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_INTRO_2,"I'm a ranger turned barkeep, but I find this monster form is excellent at serving customers!"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_INTRO_3,"Ah! You must be here to investigate the [wave amp=30 freq=10]spooky cellar[/wave] as well?"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_INTRO_3_OPTION_A,"Spooky cellar?"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_INTRO_3_OPTION_B,"Maybe another time"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_INTRO_3_OPTION_B_1,"My apologies. We might not look it but we're quite full right now."
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_INTRO_3_OPTION_B_2,"Please do stop by another time."
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_INTRO_4,"Indeed. To put it bluntly, our cook was most disappointed to find out our cellar vanished."
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_INTRO_4_KAYLEIGH,"I'd not heard of something like that happening before..."
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_INTRO_4_MEREDITH,"Huh. What? How does a cellar go missing?"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_INTRO_4_EUGENE,"This sounds suspicious {player}!"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_INTRO_4_FELIX,"There's always something new on this island huh?"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_INTRO_4_VIOLA,"A most curious tale..."
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_INTRO_5,"Fortunately, it came back! Fully stocked with a collection of delicious ingredients too..."
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_INTRO_6,"Unfortunately, eating the food seems to send you [wave amp=30 freq=10]somewhere else[/wave]..."
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_INTRO_7,"The last ranger to explore has started calling it the False Wirral, but they've never made it to end..."
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_MENU,"What can I do for you today?"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_OPTION_A,"What does this False Wirral look like?"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_OPTION_A_1,"Patrons always start out somewhere that looks a lot like this fine establishment!"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_OPTION_A_2,"The further in you travel, the more things look like other areas of New Wirral."
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_OPTION_A_3,"Nobody has reached the end yet though. Perhaps you could be the first!"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_OPTION_B,"Can we come back?"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_OPTION_B_1,"Oh![pause] How could I forget such a detail!"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_OPTION_B_2,"Every ranger we've sent in so far eventually lost a battle and woke up here again."
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_OPTION_B_3,"Interestingly, they said they saw other rangers in there that they didn't recognise..."
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_OPTION_C,"Ask about the bar"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_OPTION_C_1,"This bar is the Djinnterlude. Why not relax and leave the world at the door?"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_OPTION_C_2,"We have delightful music, a delicious menu, and a disappearing cellar..."
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_OPTION_C_3,"I would recommend the house special.\nIt is seasoned with ingredients from beyond, ideal for equally seasoned explorers."
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_OPTION_D,"Order the house special"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_OPTION_D_1,"Fine choice. I can't wait to hear what you find!"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_OPTION_E,"Leave"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_OPTION_E_1,"Farewell! Do stop by again."
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_VICTORY_1a,"An Archangel![pause] In our cellar!?"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_VICTORY_1b,"That would have been quite the draw for business! Though that whole sculpting thing sounds a bit troubling..."
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_VICTORY_1c,"Things did seem to return to normal for a while, but unfortunately before you woke up the strangeness started again..."
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_VICTORY_2a,"The Archangel came back![pause] To our cellar!?"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_VICTORY_2b,"That will be quite the draw for business! Though that whole fake reality thing is a bit worrying..."
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_VICTORY_2c,"It does seem though that this False Wirral is still very much doing its thing..."
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_VICTORY_3a,"It looks like you made another successful trip!"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_VICTORY_3b,"Your stories have been great to retell for business! Though the whole returning again and again things is a bit concerning..."
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_VICTORY_3c,"The good news is, the cellar is still restocking itself and at least we have more answers now!"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_DEFEAT_1,"Ah, so you ran into a tough opponent too..."
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_DEFEAT_2,"Hmm, that place does seem quite dangerous..."
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_DEFEAT_3,"Unfortunate. I take it you will be ordering again though..."
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_LEAVE_1,"Oh, you can use the stations to get out?"
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_LEAVE_2,"Those stations are pretty useful. If only they did return trips..."
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_LOOT_1,"We found some new items on the shelves after you returned. I think these belong to you..."
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_LOOT_2,"Much like last time, we had some new items arrive. Here's what we found..."
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_LOOT_3,"Oh! Here's the items you bought back.."
AP7_DUNGEON_DJINNTERLUDE_DJINN_DONE,"Farewell! Do stop by again."

AP7_DUNGEON_PASSIVES_MERCHANT_OPEN,"These stickers just work on their own! Want to buy any?"
AP7_DUNGEON_GENERIC_MERCHANT_EXIT,"See you later!"
AP7_DUNGEON_CAMPSITE_TRAFFIKRAB_1,"Oh. {player}. What can I do for you?"
AP7_DUNGEON_CAMPFIRE_TRAFFIKRAB_OPTION_1,"Where are we?"
AP7_DUNGEON_CAMPFIRE_TRAFFIKRAB_OPTION_1_1,"Indeed! An excellent question.\nYou are still very much in the bounds of New Wirral."
AP7_DUNGEON_CAMPFIRE_TRAFFIKRAB_OPTION_1_2,"However, at this moment you are on something closer to a reflection of the island, rather than the island itself."
AP7_DUNGEON_CAMPFIRE_TRAFFIKRAB_OPTION_2,"Can we leave?"
AP7_DUNGEON_CAMPFIRE_TRAFFIKRAB_OPTION_2_1,"Of course! The Mer-Line's gracious service extends to ephemeral places such as this."
AP7_DUNGEON_CAMPFIRE_TRAFFIKRAB_OPTION_2_2,"You are just in time for the last train from this particular station. Would you like to board?"
AP7_DUNGEON_CAMPFIRE_TRAFFIKRAB_OPTION_2_2_YES,"Excellent. The train to Falldown Mall shall depart shortly."
AP7_DUNGEON_CAMPFIRE_TRAFFIKRAB_OPTION_3,"Nothing"
AP7_DUNGEON_CAMPFIRE_TRAFFIKRAB_OPTION_3_1,"Very well!"
AP7_DUNGEON_CAMPFIRE_TRAFFIKRAB_OPTION_4,"Platform B?"
AP7_DUNGEON_CAMPFIRE_TRAFFIKRAB_OPTION_4_1,"The entity... at Platform B is quite the elusive type. I'm told it has quite the eye for detail."
AP7_DUNGEON_CAMPFIRE_TRAFFIKRAB_OPTION_4_2,"You would be wise to be wary of its fabrications, human."
AP7_DUNGEON_FINAL_TRAFFIKRAB_1,"Welcome back, {player}. How can I help?"
AP7_DUNGEON_FINAL_TRAFFIKRAB_OPTION_1,"Where did the station go?"
AP7_DUNGEON_FINAL_TRAFFIKRAB_OPTION_1_1,"Your victory over the host of this space has lead to a local dimensional collapse."
AP7_DUNGEON_FINAL_TRAFFIKRAB_OPTION_1_2,"Count yourselves fortunate. The infinite Mer-Line is committed to operating a reliable service, Long may their trains run on time!"
AP7_DUNGEON_FINAL_TRAFFIKRAB_OPTION_1_3,"You shall find the last train from this station departing shortly from the tunnel ahead."
AP7_DUNGEON_FINAL_TRAFFIKRAB_OPTION_2,"What happens now?"
AP7_DUNGEON_FINAL_TRAFFIKRAB_OPTION_2_1,"It is unclear. The avatar you were victorious over has disappeared for now, at least."
AP7_DUNGEON_FINAL_TRAFFIKRAB_OPTION_2_2,"You shall find the last train from this station departing shortly from the tunnel ahead."
AP7_DUNGEON_FINAL_TRAFFIKRAB_OPTION_2_3,"As mortal, flesh based entities, lingering here would not be a preferable choice."
AP7_DUNGEON_FINAL_TRAFFIKRAB_OPTION_3,"Leave"
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_ENTRY_1,"A ticket machine is locking the entrance."
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_ENTRY_PROMPT,"Use the show ticket?"
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_TALENT_NAME,"Comedjinn"
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_TALENT_A1,"I heard some Djinnentonics tried to create the largest mind meld the other day..."
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_TALENT_B1,"...they said they were going to start the Djinnternet."
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_TALENT_A2,"No respect.\nI don't get no respect..."
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_TALENT_B2,"I went to ranger HQ last week in my finest outfit and they said 'You want the other shipwreck!'"
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_TALENT_A3,"I even tried to be an apprentice with Captain Lodestein last summer.[pause]\nHe sent me to ranger HQ to get a 'long wait'."
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_TALENT_B3,"Well, They still haven't got back to me![pause]\nNo respect at all."
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_TALENT_A4,"Phew..."
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_TALENT_B4,"Tough crowd..."
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_BINVADER_NAME,"Rowdy Binvader"
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_BINVADER_1,"Collection day was funnier."
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_BINVADER_2,"I'm not a green bin.\nI don't take recycled material."
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_BINVADER_3,"The only tip I'm leaving is a fly tip."
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_BINVADER_4,"I was told this act was a ticket seller.\nI want to sell my ticket."
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_BINVADER_5,"I'd rather sit outside on a windy day than watch this act again."
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_BINVADER_6,"I laughed more at the holiday collection schedule."
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_BINVADER_7,"I'd rather watch a show about a blue phone box."
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_BINVADER_8,"We traveled all this way, and this is the only act that's on?"
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_BARKEEP_NAME,"Allie"
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_BARKEEP_INTRO_1a,"Welcome to the Allie Inn.\nSorry about the crowd - They've been heckling all day."
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_BARKEEP_MENU,"What can I do for you?"
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_BARKEEP_OPTION_1,"Rowdy customers?"
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_BARKEEP_OPTION_2,"Order something"
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_BARKEEP_OPTION_3,"Leave"
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_BARKEEP_ITEM_1_1,"The Binvaders?\nThey spend well but they always heckle our talent..."
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_BARKEEP_ITEM_1_2,"Perhaps you could ask them to leave? I can give you some things previous rangers left behind."
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_BARKEEP_ITEM_1_CONFIRM,"Offer to take out the trash?"
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_BARKEEP_ITEM_1_START_1,"We haven't finished our heckling yet!"
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_BARKEEP_ITEM_1_START_2,"We will make you regret this!"
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_BARKEEP_ITEM_1_END,"Great work dealing with that rowdy bunch.\nTake this, it's on the house..."
AP7_DUNGEON_INN_BARKEEP_ITEM_2_1,"Sure - here's the menu!"

AP7_VOLATILE_RANGER_BATTLE_ALEPH,"{player.to_upper}\n\nI SHALL ONE DAY RETURN AS LONG AS YOUR KIND SEEKS TO CONQUER\n\nREMEMBER THAT"
AP7_VOLATILE_RANGER_BATTLE_CLOWN,"ROLL UP, ROLL UP!\n\nANOTHER WORLD OF CREATION AWAITS US!"
AP7_VOLATILE_RANGER_VICTORY_KAYLEIGH,"I hope defeating the ranger has stopped what was happening here. I don't trust that sticker though {player}."
AP7_VOLATILE_RANGER_VICTORY_MEREDITH,"We did it, mate! I think this ranger will be ok now."
AP7_VOLATILE_RANGER_VICTORY_EUGENE,"We've put a stop to another evil plan {player}!\nI wonder what that sticker is..."
AP7_VOLATILE_RANGER_VICTORY_FELIX,"I thought we'd already got the best of the Archangels?\nDid that sticker have something to do with this?"
AP7_VOLATILE_RANGER_VICTORY_VIOLA,"It appears we've foiled the machinations of an archangel once again."

AP7_DUNGEON_RANGER_BATTLE_5,"I've not seen you before, are you a new recruit?"
AP7_DUNGEON_RANGER_BATTLE_6,"What's with these sigil stickers?"
AP7_DUNGEON_RANGER_BATTLE_7,"I wonder if there is an end to this place?"
AP7_DUNGEON_RANGER_BATTLE_8,"It's dangerous down here. Are you ready for what's ahead?"
AP7_DUNGEON_RANGER_BATTLE_9,"I saw a rowdy group of bins rolling through the mall before..."
AP7_DUNGEON_RANGER_BATTLE_10,"No! I wont share any of the treasure!"
AP7_DUNGEON_RANGER_BATTLE_11,"I'm going to give that Djinn a piece of my mind when I get back. I just wanted some dinner."
AP7_DUNGEON_RANGER_BATTLE_12,"I almost got eaten by a treasure chest! No way am I losing to you!"
AP7_DUNGEON_RANGER_BATTLE_13,"Getting tired? I'll make this quick..."
AP7_DUNGEON_RANGER_BATTLE_14,"So is this where the all the stock in the mall came from?"

AP7_DUNGEON_RANGER_DEFEAT_6,"I heard there is one that lets you bring tapes out of here.\nI've never seen it though..."
AP7_DUNGEON_RANGER_DEFEAT_7,"If you find it, tell me!"
AP7_DUNGEON_RANGER_DEFEAT_8,"I guess it was me who wasn't ready enough"
AP7_DUNGEON_RANGER_DEFEAT_9,"Put out with the garbage..."
AP7_DUNGEON_RANGER_DEFEAT_10,"Ok! I guess there is enough to go around!"

AP7_DUNGEON_RANGER_DEFEAT_23,"I shouldn't have given away my best move..."
AP7_DUNGEON_RANGER_DEFEAT_24,"But you're pretty tough, you can use it I guess..."
AP7_DUNGEON_RANGER_DEFEAT_25,"I'll get you next time!"

AP7_DUNGEON_QUEST_KUNEKO_NOFLAG,"Hmm... Victory in combat... Blessing of a shrine..."
AP7_DUNGEON_QUEST_KUNEKO_NOSHRINE,"Oh! I've seen some of those shrines around here. Maybe there is one deeper in..."
